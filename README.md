The project is both in deep learning and mathematics. The goal is to develop the theory behind a new algorithm of deep learning, using aneural network to understand the dynamics of a diffusion data (e.g. spread of epidemmics, heat diffusion in media, how infromation travels through social networks, etc...). The students will study with professor Luca Capogna the necessary math background.
Crandall Ligget Theorem is going to be used to develop the algorithm. The plan is to then focys on impleneting the theory through Python, running synthetic data testings.
